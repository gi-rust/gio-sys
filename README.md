This project is a prototyping testbed used to help implement
the code generator and test the binding infrastructure of
[Grust](https://github.com/gi-rust/grust).

Though the library crates under `fake-gen` are manually edited,
they are meant to simulate the output of the eventual code generator
given real introspection data for the libraries being bound.
